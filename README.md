# About this layout

- This is my favorite 65-layout keyboard configuration
- This layout is optimized for Visual Studio Code (1.89.0 Universal). I can drill into definitions (F12) and quickly jump to errors in a workspace (Right Shift + Backspace)

I use this layout with the [Mode Envoy](https://modedesigns.com/products/envoy)
