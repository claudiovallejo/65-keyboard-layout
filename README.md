# About this layout

* This is my favorite 65-layout keyboard configuration
* This layout allows me use Visual Studio Code (1.89.0 Universal) most quickly
* I can drill into definitions (replace Caps Lock with F12) and jump to errors in a workspace (Right Shift + Backspace)

I use this layout with the [Mode Envoy](https://modedesigns.com/products/envoy)
